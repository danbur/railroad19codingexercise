2. Variety  of testing types (examples: boundary, happy path, negative, etc)
3. Code structure and organization
4. Naming conventions
5. Code readability
6. Code modularity


#### Exercise
1. Review the spec in the root directory, PizzaAPIReferenceDoc.  API endpoints for this exercise can be found here
   https://my-json-server.typicode.com/sa2225/demo/ 
   This is a demo endpoint and not fully implemented.  Please write your code and test cases against the spec.  Any test cases that are failing because of the end point implementation please add a comment in the code noting the failure and why.
2. In the Read me file, write up all of the test cases you think are necessary to test the endpoints defined in the provided spec.
3. Code up a few examples of 
  - order get call including response validation
  - order post call
4. When complete please check your code into a public git repo
